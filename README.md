## My process

1. Sketch out design on paper. Label elements using semantic tags.
2. Make html file with sections as per sketch.
3. Create CSS file with resets, custom properties.
4. Apply fonts, colors and aesthetic features to the elements.
5. Apply layout, positioning to elements.
6. Generous tweaking to match design as closely as possible.
7. Make adjustments to achieve desktop design on larger screens.
8. Fiddle and tweak a lot more.
9. Reach a point where I'm sick of fiddling and it looks good enough.
10. Final commit, edit this readme file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS resets
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I feel like I improved the responsiveness of this project over other projects I have done. I think it helped to avoid defining sizes of elements except when necessary (especially widths).

### Continued development

I want to try to understand how pixel-perfect a web developer is expected to be in terms of achieving the project design. Clearly, there is a point of diminishing returns where it is no longer an efficient use of time trying to dial in perfect accuracy.

### Useful resources

- MDN
- Codepen (for quickly trying out a concept on its own)
